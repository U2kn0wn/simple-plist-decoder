# plist-decoder

A simple Python tool that **recursively scans a folder for `.plist` files**, decodes them (supports both binary and XML formats), and prints the result in a readable JSON-like format.

Useful during **mobile app pentesting**, **iOS IPA analysis**, or **reverse engineering** to inspect app configuration files such as `Info.plist`, `app metadata`, and privacy usage descriptions.

## ‚úÖ Features

- Recursively finds all `.plist` files in a folder
    
- Supports **binary and XML plist formats**
    
- Automatically converts plist objects into readable JSON
    
- Handles dates, bytes, and Apple UID types safely
    
- Prints results cleanly:
    ```
    <Path to plist>
	<Decoded data>
    ```
