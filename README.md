# plist-decoder

A simple Python tool that **recursively scans a folder for `.plist` files**, decodes them (supports both binary and XML formats), and prints the result in a readable JSON-like format.

Useful during **mobile app pentesting**, **iOS IPA analysis**, or **reverse engineering** to inspect app configuration files such as `Info.plist`, `app metadata`, and privacy usage descriptions.

	<Decoded data>
    ```
